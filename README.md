# ESP32-CYD-Menu-Script
A small part of a bigger project i'm working on, this is a interactive menu built to be expanded on. To be installed on a esp32-cyd TFT display (touchscreen))


Refer to the cheetsheet / driver to see how the developer of the driver (not me) has made functions work and what arguments they take.
